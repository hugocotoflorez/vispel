# ViSPeL Specification

Very Simple Programming Language. The name is choosen because it's memory
unsafe and everything is a pointer.

## Compiler

The compiler is a generic implementation of a generic non-existing language.
Vispel compiler would be written once I know what I'm doing.

## Compiler Standard

The makefile compiles the compiler using C99 standard. It uses stb_ds as the
unique dependency.
